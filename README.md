2. Clone repo.
    1. In Visual Studio, go to **Team Explorer** → **Clone** → Enter https://github.com/VirtoCommerce/vc-theme-b2b.git as URL and **C:\vc-theme-b2b** (for example) as path.
    2. Or execute command

    ```
    (where **C:\vc-platform\VirtoCommerce.Platform.Web\App_Data\cms-content** is path to CMS content storage configured at platform & storefront deployment steps, **'B2B-Store'** is your store name and **'C:\vc-theme-b2b'** is path to your theme repo).
4. Open theme folder in your IDE
    1. Go to **File** → **Open** → **Folder**

5. Install Node.js dependencies. Run
    ```
    npm install
    ```
    to install Node.js dependencies.

## Prerequisites

### Storefront

You need to have local installation of storefront. Follow [this article](https://github.com/VirtoCommerce/vc-storefront-core/blob/master/README.md) step-by-step to install storefront from binaries or source code.

### Node.js

1. Install Node.js v12.0.0 or above (we recommend [latest LTS version](https://nodejs.org/en/))
2. Execute the following command: `npm install --global --production windows-build-tools`

## Liquid reference

Liquid is the templating engine that powers Virto Commerce templates. Go to [Liquid documentation](https://virtocommerce.com/docs/vc2devguide/working-with-storefront/theme-development/liquid-reference).


## Bundling & minification

*Main article: [bundling & minification on virtocommerce.com/docs](https://virtocommerce.com/docs/vc2devguide/working-with-storefront/theme-development/bundling-and-minification)*

Bundling is a technique you can use to improve request load time. Bundling improves load time by reducing the number of requests to the server (assets such as CSS and JavaScript will be combined to single file per file format).

### How bundling and minification works

#### How to add bundle to layout

```
{% raw %}{{ 'bundle/scripts.js' | static_asset_url | append_version | script_tag }}{% endraw %}
```
  * **static_asset_url** means that this file is static content of site
  * **script_tag** or **stylesheet_tag** will generate
    ```
    <script ... >
    ```
    or
    ```
    <link rel="stylesheet" ... >
    ```
  * **append_version** is used to correctly invalidate browser cache for bundles. It calculate hash of file and append it as part of query string in url. Make sure that it's added after **static_content_url** (or other url filter), not after **script_tag**, **stylesheet_tag** (or other html tags).

#### Bundling and minification process workflow

When you run the **default** task to bundle & minify theme, the following happens:
1. ESLint runs and output warnings and errors in javascript code.
2. Javascript minifies and source maps generates.
3. CSS processes by [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) with [the following browsers support](https://virtocommerce.com/docs/vc2userguide/what-is-commerce-manager/minimum-requirements) (documentation may be sometimes outdated; browser versions specified in gulpfile then specified in docs, not vice versa).
4. CSS minifies and source maps generates.

![Bundling and minification flowchart](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6369252/29952970-3b946cba-8ee6-11e7-8f15-55e4123c0da7.png "Bundling and minification flowchart")

### Commands

> **Attention:** while theme including **bundlesconfig.json** file, you *must not* use [Bundler & Minifier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MadsKristensen.BundlerMinifier) Visual Studio extension with theme. We're using gulp to bundle & minify files on theme, because it support a lot of possible customizations and has a plugins for css minification and correct source maps generation. Wrong source map generation and lack of css minification is a primary reason why we do not use Bundler & Minifier extension in Visual Studio.

Run
```
npx gulp watch
```
on command line if you want to bundle & minify files on save or run
```
npx gulp default
```
manually when you need to bundle & minify theme files.

The following gulp tasks available to you: 
1. **default**: default task. Bundles and minifies theme files.
2. **clean**: removes bundled & minified files.
3. **lint**: runs **eslint** to check for warnings & errors in javascript files. Look at [eslint site](https://eslint.org/) for details.
4. **min** and **min:js**, **min:css**, **min:html**: minify all or specified types of files.
6. **watch**: watching to any changes on bundled & configuration files and update bundles when any change occurs.
7. **compress**: creates zip package with all needed files to deploy theme on storefront.

## How to localize theme

*Main article: [how to localize theme on virtocommerce.com/docs](https://virtocommerce.com/docs/vc2devguide/working-with-storefront/theme-development/bundling-and-minification)*

### Adding new translation to theme

Storefront theme localization is very similar to [VirtoCommerce Platform localization](https://virtocommerce.com/docs/vc2devguide/working-with-platform-manager/localization-implementation). Check it for details on working with translation files.

1. Make a copy of &lt;*theme repository location*&gt;\locales\en.default.json file 
2. Rename the copied file to begin with your needed language 2 letter code (e.g., "es.default.json"). 
3. Translate the file content.

### Adding new language to store
1. Open your store in VirtoCommerce Platform ( **More → Browse → Stores → &lt;*your store*&gt;** ).
2. Check whether your language exists in the "Additional languages" available values list or add it in case it's missing:
